3 Observable Trends: 

There are significantly more male players than any other gender. Male-dominated
(484M, 81F, 11other) 

However, the average total purchase per person for women is higher than for men. ($4.47>$4.07)  

Most players are in their 20's with the largest count being in the 20-24 range and the lowest count being in the 40+ category.  

Other Notes: 

Within the 576 players, there were 780 purchases.  

Females seems to be more willing to spend more than the males but there are less female players of the game. In order to drive up revenue, it would be important to target how to increase the number of female players.  

With regards to age, players who are in the 35-39 age range also have a higher average total purchase per person. It would be interesting to see if the female players also tend to sit in this age range.
